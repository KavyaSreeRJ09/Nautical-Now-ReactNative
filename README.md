# Nautical Now
Nautical Now is a mobile application designed to enhance the safety and efficiency of fishermen by providing real-time ocean weather forecasts and critical information. The app aims to support fishermen in making informed decisions while navigating ocean waters, ultimately ensuring their safety and improving their fishing experience.

# Description
Nautical Now is a mobile application developed using the React Native framework that leverages a Python LSTM model to assess ocean safety. The model is trained on wave height data, analyzing it coordinate-wise to determine risk factors in real-time. By fetching the user's coordinates, Nautical Now provides critical information about the safety of specific regions for fishermen. This innovative approach ensures that users can make informed decisions while navigating the ocean, enhancing their safety and experience. With a user-friendly interface, the app combines advanced technology with practical utility for maritime activities.
